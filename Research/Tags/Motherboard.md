#Hardware

abbreviated MOBO

The motherboard is the foundation of a computer. Its primary function is to connect different devices into a Vonn-Neumann computer architecture and to regulate power input to devices.

# [[Motherboard Form Factor]]
The physical dimensions (including the placement of screws) are standardized to fit different cases and device sizes.
The form factor also determines the power pinouts and connectors.

# [[CPU Socket]]s
CPUs and MOBOs have standardized interfaces to allow for unique CPU features and communication to the computer.
	The socket also determines which Chipset is used.

# System Memory
![[System Memory Form Factors]]
# [[Expansion Slot]]s
A multitude of slots connected to the MOBO. There are hundreds of types of slots, and standards. Whichever type of slot depends on the MOBO manufacturer.

Expansion slots are used for connected extra devices to add features to a computer
	Graphics cards
	Extra storage
	network interface cards
	Etc

# ![[IO Panel]]


# Header Ports
Non-hotswappable / non-plug-n-play IO ports.
	Controlling fans
	Controlling liquid cooling pumps
	Controlling RGB
	Connecting to PC Case buttons

# Voltage Regulation Modules
Physical controller chips soldered to the MOBO to control voltage given to different devices.

# [[CMOS]] Battery
A coin battery typically a cr2032 that provides a constant 3 volts to the CMOS memory for years.

# [[Motherboard Power Ports]]
Used for powering the computer. Connects to the [[PSU]] or battery somewhere on the PC case.

# ROM ![[ROM]]

# [[TPM]]
Increasingly, modern MOBOs are being built with TPM modules to provide cryptographic hardware support.
