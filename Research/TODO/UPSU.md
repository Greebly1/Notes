Uninterruptible [[PSU]] 

A PSU that contains chargeable batteries that can supply power for a limited time from the batteries.
	Useful for power outages

# Considerations
- Quality of output [[AC]] power from battery backup mode
- Max watt load (you don't want to exceed 50-65%)
- Software monitors (some even notify you)
- Built-in [[Surge Protector]]
- Capacity and backup time
- Modularity (can you extend the battery size)
- Battery hot-swap (when you need to replace the batteries you don't need to power off the system)

# Common Uses
- Power workstation long enough for users to save and shutdown properly without losing work
- Continue powering [[Printers]] during heavy print jobs, especially [[3D Printers]]
- Maintain power to a server or server cluster until backup generators turn on
