The card name provides information about your [[M.2]] card. For example, connectorized SSDs typically come in three dimensions: 2242, 2260, and 2280. The first two digits represent the width in millimeters (mm), while the last two digits represent the length in mm.

To standardize the names of different modules, a naming convention is defined in PCI Express M.2 Specification Revision 4.0 Version 1.0. The following table defines the size, component assembly (single-/double-sided, maximum height), interface, and other important information about the card.![[m2Sizes.png]]

The key of a M.2 ultimately determines what slot it can be plugged into. The pins listed in the specification say which pins a key is missing.

# M and B Key
The two most common keys used are B and M.
B
	Supports PCIex2 and SATA
M
	Supports PCIex4
B + M
	Combined key, supports PCIex4 or SATA![[M2Keying.png]]
