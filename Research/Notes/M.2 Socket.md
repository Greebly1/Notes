Like a CPU has its socket, M.2 also has its sockets. These though are defined by the MOBO implementation as an [[Expansion Slot]]

Whatever protocols a socket type supports varies by MOBO.
M.2_1
	Primarily SATA
	Primarily for WIFI cards
M.2_2
	SATA or PCIex2
	Typically uses B [[M.2 Keying]]
M.2_3
	Typically PCIex4 for NVMe SSDs
	Typically routed through the [[PCH]].
