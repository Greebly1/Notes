Not to be confused with [[Recovery Mode]]

Safe mode is a special boot option for a #Windows machine that (by default) disables networking and uses bare minimum systems. 

This is useful for troubleshooting and repair, since it allows you to boot into a more stable mode to edit the registry or scan system files.

# Generic Drivers
In safe mode, only the bare minimum [[Generic Driver]]s are used. This helps improve stability.
