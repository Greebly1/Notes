# Shielding
In rare cases, such as high voltage industrial settings, ethernet cables may be coated in an aluminum shield or a braid material similar to coaxial cable. This helps protect the channel from outside interference.

For all other cases, residential, commercial, and even data centers, unshielded cable is used.

There are many many different shielding types, all providing different levels of protection. The cheapest and most common type being UTP (unshielded twisted pair)

# Plenum (CMP) & Riser (CMR)
The outside sheath of Ethernet is made from PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) a cheap plastic alloy. When it heats to burn it releases a toxic gas. Due to the reduced air flow and heating of the wall-space, and the risk it poses during a fire, Ethernet intended to run through walls must be plenum grade (CMP) or riser grade (CMR).
	Plenum space means below and above floors
	Riser space means wall-space
In both cases, the cable is coated in a fire retardant chemical.

# Exterior Jackets (CMX)
For use outdoors, especially for underground burial, jackets must be waterproof, and able to withstand erosion and prolonged UV radiation.
	You may also want to consider cables with anti-bacterial coatings to protect against corrosion.
Outdoor cable may and often should also be *armored*, made of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), which compared to PVC, is resistant to cuts, crushing, abrasion, etc.
# Shape
Cables themself come in a few shapes beneficial to specific scenarios
**Standard Round**
**Slim/Ultra-Slim**
	Thinner diameter, increases airflow in dense equipment racks.
**Flat**
	Better heat dissipation
	Less prone to tangling (good for backpacks and commuting)
	Fits flush in many circumstances (carpets, walls, behind furniture)

# Color
Good central telecom rooms have clear ordering and rules to the cabling. Color coded cables massively improve clarity of complex jumbles of wire.
