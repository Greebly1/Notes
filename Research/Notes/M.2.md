Developed by the PCIe SIG, M.2 was originally known as the NGFF (Next Generation Form Factor)
	It was based on [[mSATA]]

# Soldered vs Connectorized
M.2 as a connector may be soldered down using a Ball-Grid-array #BGA. This is still the same M.2 that the MOBO expects, only it is soldered and not intended to be removed.

Connectorized M.2 is what we typically think of. It uses a special gold-plated connector keyed to a specific type of M.2.
