A data bus technique that improves data reliability and signal integrity at the cost of extra wires.

Differential signal wires are often grouped in 4, to create a full-duplex lane

1s and 0s are sent as differences in the two wires
1
	Positive wire voltage greater than negative wire
0
	Negative wire voltage greater than positive wire

So a full duplex lane with 4 wires, has two pairs of positive and negative wires
	One pair for sending
	One pair for receiving
