[[CPU]]

The socket is a slot containing a standardized [[CPU]], connecting it to the [[Motherboard]]'s power and communication wires without the need of soldering.

# More Than A Connection
The pins of a socket define an #API for the CPU and MOBO. So while there is a physical socket, in information space it is used by both sides of manufacturers to adhere to.
The socket defines the features a MOBO supports for a CPU to perform. 
Typically there is a 'best in slot' CPU for a given socket that utilizes all features to their fullest potential.
	Sockets are said to support a CPU Generation

# Socket Types
There are hundreds of types of sockets

#Intel and #AMD have their own sockets
Today the modern AMD socket is
	Socket #AM5
# Clock Speed
Difficulties in signal integrity call for increasingly improved materials and techniques that allow the clock speed to increase without losses to signal integrity.
A given socket will support a max clock speed.

# [[Chipset]]
The aforementioned API defines what chipset that CPU generation will be able to support.
This includes the number of directly connected PCIe lanes.
Lastly it also determines what generation of [[DDR Version]] a CPU expects
