A #Security principle that makes it more difficult for threat actors to exploit a system as well as quarantine potential breaches.

It states that a user/person should be given the least amount of power and privileges that they need to do their job.

	A student user should not be given access to teacher resources, and a teacher should not be given access to high level staff resources.

In the event of a compromised user account, it controls the amount of data compromised.
