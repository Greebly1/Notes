# Maintenance
- Clean print heads
	Ink clogs the output holes
	Causes streaks of white line **throughout entire page**
	Many printers have automatic cleaning process (configure it to run every day), sometimes it is only manually start-able
	Print heads/cartridges can be manually removed for manual cleaning
- Replace empty/low ink cartridges
	Make sure it is the correct proprietary cartridge brand for your printer
- Calibrate printer
	Aligns nozzles to the paper. Ensure lines are crisp and colors do not overlap.
All printer should have a calibration function
- Clear paper jams
	Remove paper tray, remove clogged paper
	May need to tell printer software to release tension, or press a special button
