[[RIR]]

The IPv4 address space was much too small to support the global infrastructure.
	IPv6, being 128 bits long it can support all devices ever needed

# Globally Unique
Every IPv6 address is globally unique, enforced by a [[RIR]]

# ![[Network Prefix]]
# Routing IPv6
Due to the hierarchical nature of the internet infrastructure, routers can infer the network prefix of an IPv6 address based on which port it came from. This is because Routers remember what network each port leads to. 
	They learn this information dynamically through RAs
