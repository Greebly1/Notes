AKA
	M.3
	Next Generation Small Form Factor (NGSFF)
	Samsung enterprise m.2

NF1 was Samsung's attempt to develop a new form factor that would rein supreme in both portable consumer devices, and #Enterprise data centers.

# M.2 Extension
NF1 is functionally an extension of the [[M.2]] interface, using the same port and a few unused pins.
However, the PCI SIG has issued a warning regarding the usage of M.2 SSDs in NF1 slots

# Storage
NF1 essentially allows M.2 SSDs to have up to 8TB of storage, and includes great cooling.


# Lack of Adoption
While NF1 was a great SSD technology, it was proprietary, owned by Samsung and very expensive.

To make matters worse, shortly after being released, the SNIA released [[EDSFF]], which has since become the de-facto standard.

It is still in use though, allegedly, in Samsung servers. We may also see a future where NF1 slots are on consumer portable electronics.
