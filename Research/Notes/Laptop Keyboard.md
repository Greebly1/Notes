All keyboards connect to the main board via a keyboard ribbon cable header
	However they are fitted to the case differently.
1 May be a full keyboard block removable and accessible from the front
2 May be inset keys pushed through a keyboard mesh of the laptop frame, not easily removable, often need to go through the back.
