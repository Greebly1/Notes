[[WiFi]]

A frequency band is a range of frequencies. In [[WiFi]], there are 3 main bands. However there are many many more bands used for specific communication protocols and industries.

# 2.4 GHz
Long range, and good wall penetration, but highly congested
**US Regulations**
14 channels, 2MHz wide
	**Only 3 are non-overlapping**
	1, 6, and 11
Used in 
- certain [[WiFi Standards]]
- Early [[Cellular]]
-  [[Bluetooth]]
- Microwaves and industrial machines (unintentional)
- [[IOT]] devices and protocols
- most drones

# 5 GHz
Shorter range, less congestion, and faster 
But worse wall penetration

24 channels, 20MHz wide, all non-overlapping
	However, it overlaps with radar frequencies.
Utilizes **Dynamic Frequency Selection** on specific channels
	Detect and switch away from channels being used in radar automatically.
	Some devices may not even support DFS, meaning they just don't use those channels. 
Allows for channel bonding to form wider channels --> [[EMF Channel]]

Used for
- Certain [[WiFi Standards]]
- Cellular standards
- [[Bluetooth]] 5.0
- Radar
- Wireless VR goggles

# 60 GHz
Exceedingly poor wall penetration, very short range, best speed
6 channels, 2.16 GHz wide, non-overlapping
