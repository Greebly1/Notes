There are a myriad of form factors. 
![[MOBOFormFactors.png]]
These are the most common
	EATX - Super high end gaming/workstations
	ATX - Standard PC
	Micro-ATX - Smaller PC
	Mini-ITX - Super small PC

# ATX vs ITX
![[ATX]]

# Case Requirements
[[PC Case]]s need to fit the correct MOBO form factor or it will not work.
Some larger cases such as a ATX case may have a conversion frame to support Micro-ATX or even Mini-ITX.
	However the IO port may not fit very well

# IO Port Shield
The IO port shield is sized to fit certain form factors. A ITX IOPort is smaller than an EATX IOPort.
