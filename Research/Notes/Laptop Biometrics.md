The most common form of biometric for a laptop is simply a fingerprint reader.

A laptop that supports a build-in fingerprint reader will ahve a slot on the front near the keyboard. Behind it is a fingerprint reader card connected to the MOBO by a ribbon cable.

	Whatever fingerprint reader used should conform to windows hello driver compatibility, or be open-source.
