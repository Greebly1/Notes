A 4th pin allows the fan to be controlled using pulse-width-modulation.
	Due to friction in a fan's motors, it is difficult to run a fan using older voltage based control at low speeds.
	However, pulsing the max voltage quickly (or slowly) can overcome this friction and run the fan at very low speeds.

# Legacy Support
If it is connected to a 3 pin or 2 pin slot, it will simply operate using the older modes.
