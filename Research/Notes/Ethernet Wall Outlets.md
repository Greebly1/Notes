All connectors must connect to something. While this is typically an ethernet port of a network interface card, just as often it is a wall socket serving as an extension of a router or switch. 

# Category Matters
Just like connectors, for optimal performance, wall outlets should be rated for the same category as the cable plugged into them. 

# Types
- Standard faceplate: SOHO
- Multi-port faceplate
- Recessed: a deeply recessed box in the wall, often combined with an hdmi and power port
- Keystone: 45 degree angled for tight spaces
- Low-profile keystone: 90 angle, for extremely tight spaces, ethernet cable does not protrude.
- Wireless Access Point: Doubles as a wireless access point
