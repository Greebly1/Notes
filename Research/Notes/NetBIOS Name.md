A [[NetBIOS]] name is 16 #ASCII characters

Typically (on Windows) the last character is for the netbios suffix. Which means that the first 15 letters identify the computer, and the last letter for the program.
	In this scenario applications using netbios would register themself with the netbios software on the OS, and receive a netbios suffix.

To see your computers netbios name, use the [[Hostname]] command.
