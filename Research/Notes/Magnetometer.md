AKA metal detector

A [[Physical Security]] system used to detect if a person is carrying anything metal, such as a gun.

Some difficulties are posed, for instance people can now 3D print guns without metal. And some people have metal implants such as spinal support columns.

Stronger detectors can image someone using x-ray, or scan for stolen, unpaid-for items.
