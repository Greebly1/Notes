Remote Desktop Protocol

A proprietary protocol developed by #Microsoft used for controlling endpoints remotely. 
	While it is #proprietary, a number of extensions for it exist that allows it to control Mac, and Linux machines.

A RDP client sends a message containing authentication details to [[TCP Port]] 3389 to a RDP server to start a connection.

The data is split into multiple channels for audio, input, video, etc.

Each channel is encrypted.
