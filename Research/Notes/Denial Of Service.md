DOS

A #Cyber-Attack by which the service you provide as an administrator (database server, AI server, power grid server, etc) is taken down. 

It denies service to everyone trying to use it.

When done to a publicly traded company, this usually causes a drop in stock prices. DOS attacks are often paired with stock short selling, and money moved into crypto accounts.
