Liquid-Crystal Display
A type of [[Computer Display]] that uses an array of liquid crystals that when given an electrical current, alter the polarity of light passing through
	Combining this tech with polarity filtering films and a back light allows for the creation of a display.
# Backlight
LCDs utilize different types of backlights to generate light to be polarized.
Two types
- Fluorescent Backlight
		Warmer, larger, more power use
- LED Backlight
		Better Contrast Ratio, less power use, thinner
- Mini LED
		Imitates [[OLED]] with a very very thin LED backlight

# Manufacture Technique
There are 3 types of crystal arrays0
