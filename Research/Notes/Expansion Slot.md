An Expansion slot on a [[Motherboard]] is a way to add, upgrade and customize features of your computer by adding an #Expansion-Card

Expansion Cards are kind of like their own computers, they are made of their own printed circuit board, and may even have a limited Operating system installed.

# Uses
Expansion slots are used for adding, removing, or upgrading functionality such as
	- Graphics Processing Units
	- Network Interface Cards
	- Extra Ports
	- Hard Drives
	- WIFI / Bluetooth features
	- Cellular features
	- Disk Drives
	- Diagnostics Tools

# Protocols
Over the years many, many protocols and connectors and keying methods have been developed
- [[PCI]]
- [[PCIe]]
- USB may also be considered an expansion bus standard
Are the most common

# [[Hard Drive Slots]]
While these are not 'expansion slots' they are similar in that they allow upgrading and additional memory to be slotted in.

# Keying
The actual connector port of the expansion slot is keyed to a specific connector.
Just because the slot uses PCIe, doesn't mean it will be a regular PCIe slot
	It might be M.2
		Or it might be mPCIe
