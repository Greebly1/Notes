[[WiFi]] [[PHY Rate]] 

Radios have existed long before modern computers, it is only natural that we have developed the means for endpoints to communicate wirelessly.
Mostly for mobile devices such as phones, tablets, and laptops, wireless communication is extremely convenient for the end user.

# 802.11
Developed by IEEE, 802.11 is the standardized protocol that we call WIFI. It has many extensions.

The most important thing to know about each extension is the [[EMF Bands]] it operates in. 
	2.4, 5, 60

Typically but not always, whatever standard a device is rated for, is the minimum standard it supports. During the [[Association Phase]], two devices will determine which standard they must use to speak to one another.
