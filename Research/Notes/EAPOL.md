	[[EAP]] over LAN

Refers to implementing the EAP standard in a LAN. 
In this scenario
**Supplicant** - Device/user trying to connect to network
**Authenticator** - Any access points to the network, points to the auth server (connected through a manually entered shared secret key)
**Authentication Server** - A static IP server that tracks users and authenticates them
