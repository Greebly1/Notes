A very common upgrade to make on a laptop to increase speed and memory size.

Special Laptop SSDs can be bought specifically formed to fit certain laptop HDD form factors for replacement.

Any old laptops being upgraded to SSD will almost certainly use SATA SSD. Not NVME SSD. 
	Since NVME only recently was made.

# Upgrade Process
1. Backup entire drive to new SSD
2. Use USB to SATA adapter
3. Use a drive [[Cloning Software]], such as Macrium Reflect (probably also [[Defragment]] afterwards)
4. Remove old HDD
5. Insert new SATA SSD
6. Connect SATA connection
7. Screw in screws
8. Reinstall back panel.

There may be a special retention frame that holds the HDD in place instead, this can be removed and affixed to the SSD.
