Distributed [[Denial Of Service]]

 A DDOS #Cyber-Attack involves hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of network requests and overloading of the network to functionally take down a service.

# [[Botnet]]s
DDOS attacks are usually perpetrated by botnets, since they can't really just be blocked since they might represent a user who is unaware they are infected by a botnet. (Although zombie computers are typically banned temporarily during a DDOS)
