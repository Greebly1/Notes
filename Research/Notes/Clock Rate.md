AKA
	CPU Frequency
	Clock Speed

Measured in HZ

The clock rate is the speed of the cycling signal used to synchronize operations within a CPU.

Faster clock rates directly correlate to faster processing.

The MOBO provides the base system clock, this is multiplied by the CPU's clock multiplier to determine the CPUs clock speed
# [[Overclocking]]
The clock rate of a CPU is determined at system boot by the BIOS.
The BIOS not only controls the BCLK of the MOBO, but it also writes to model specific registers in a CPU to set the clock multiplier saved in CMOS.
