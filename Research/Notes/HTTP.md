Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/index.htm

The dominant protocol used to send web pages between web servers and users. 

# How it works
A HTTP web server is listening on [[TCP Port]] 80 for ![[HTTP requests]] It then responds by sending website data inside an ![[HTTP Response]]

![[HTTP.webp]]

# ![[Website]]
# Security
HTTP doesn't offer any encryption or authentication for the server. For this reason modern [[Search Engine]]s will flag websites using HTTP as unsecure.

A secure version exists --> [[HTTPS]]
