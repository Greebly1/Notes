An #authentication technique by which multiple factors prove authenticity.

There are several factors to authentication
1. Something you know --> password
2. Something you have --> key, phone, [[Smartcard]], etc aka [[Hard Token]] sometimes [[Soft Token]]
3. Something you are --> [[Biometric]]
4. Somewhere you are
5. Something you do

Most of the time we just use 2 factor authentication.

In the case of a password breach, they still could not fully authenticate. In the case of a password breach and physical theft, they still could not fully authenticate.
In order to beat all 3 factors, a password must be attained, an item must be stolen, and biometrics must be replicated somehow.
