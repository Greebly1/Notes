Top level domains (TLDs) are managed by TLD name servers
	The [[DNS Root Zone]] will find the correct TLD name server for the Domain Name they are resolving.
	EX: the Verisign .com TLD name server will be able to resolve Wikipedia.com, but not Minecraft.net

# What they do
TLDs are used to locate [[Authoritative Name Server]]s for a given [[SLD]]
They store DNS records for locating authoritative name servers
	These are very lightweight DNS records. Only storing the IP of the corresponding authoritative name server
