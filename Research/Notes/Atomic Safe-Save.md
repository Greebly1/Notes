Instead of writing micro data to a file to change it from one form to another, a temporary copy of that file is made and given a slightly different name and hidden from the file explorer.
Changes to the original file are saved to this temporary location. When it is time to write the full change, instead of writing to that file location, a name change is performed and the original data is discarded.
