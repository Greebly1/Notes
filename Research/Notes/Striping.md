A special form of [[Drive Concatenation]] used in [[RAID]] where instead of appending the start of one drive to the end of another drive, memory addresses are interleaved between all drives.

Doing this improves write and read throughput.

# Stripe width
Striping can be done with different sizes of data. For instance
- Stripe each bit
- Stripe each byte
- Stripe each word
- Stripe each block

Each has different benefits and drawbacks. For instance, striping each block improves the latency of small reads, but doesnâ€™t have as good overall throughout.

However, striping each block tends to be the modern best method, since modern drives read entire blocks at a time anyways. So actually, it has the best throughput.
