Archival discs are a special form of optical media designed for higher storage capacity and much much much longer lifespans.

as the name suggests, they are for archiving information that we never want to lose.

# How
Discs lose data by being scratched, or often from bacteria that eats the plastic.
	This is called disc rot

Archival discs are given special coatings that prevent both physical abrasions and corrosion.
