DHCPv6 servers provide [[DHCP]] auto-configuration services to [[IPv6]] endpoints. 

Instead of configuring Subnet masks, DHCPv6 gives endpoints in the LAN the [[Network Prefix]]

# Backwards Compatibility
Since IPv4 still torments us, DHCPv6 servers till need to support configuring IPv4 devices. 
	This is essentially accomplished by also running a [[DHCPv4]] service as well

# SLAAC
DHCPv6 is often combined with another LAN  auto-configuration service called [[SLAAC]].
