TLDs accredit a domain name registrar to oversee the registration of domain names ([[SLD]]s) to organizations
	These registrars often sell domain names to organizations and operate the TLD servers

# Synchronization & Coherency
Registrars act as the API for controlling and configuring the DNS infrastructure. 
They synchronize the TLD servers and the [[Authoritative Name Server]]s by updating them.
