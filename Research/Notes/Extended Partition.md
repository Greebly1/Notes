A workaround for [[MBR]]'s 4 partition limit. 
	Only 1 extended partition allowed
	uses one of the 4 [[Primary Partitions]], it technically is a primary partition

Essentially it allows you to nest more [[Logical Partitions]]
	It doesn't store files, only serving as a container for the logical partitions
	Up to 128 logical partitions
