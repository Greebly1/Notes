Essentially, every device on the internet is given an [[Notes/IP]] Address, this operates like a street address to a home or building. 
	IPs are assigned in a structured hierarchy, managed by the [[IANA]]

There are two main versions of IP Addresses
- [[IPv4]]
- [[IPv6]]
	Invented to solve the issue of not enough IP addresses to go around

They both generally operate in a similar ways differing on
- Error detection
- address width (determines how many unique addresses exist)
