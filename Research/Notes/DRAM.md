Dynamic [[RAM]]

A [[RAM]] technology that stores data inside [[Capacitors]].
	Since capacitors leak charge DRAM is required to refresh capacitors regularly

Cheaper than [[SRAM]], but slower

Can access any memory address with just about the same speed.

# Types of DRAM

![[SDRAM]]
Early types of DRAM were not synchronized.

# DRAM Refresh Rate
The speed that DRAM must receive refresh signals or else it will corrupt memory.
	This is a hardware level problem/solution
