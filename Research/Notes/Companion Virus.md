Companion Viruses are a [[Malware]] technique used to execute malicious code by using the same name of a legitimate executable but a higher prioritized extension

If a companion virus creates a file named `CHKDISK.COM` alongside `CHKDISK.EXE`, and the user types `CHKDISK` at the command line, the system will execute `CHKDISK.COM` (the virus) before the legitimate `CHKDISK.EXE`
