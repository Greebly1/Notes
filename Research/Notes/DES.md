Data Encryption Standard #DES 

Created by #IBM in 1977

#TODO understand how it works, what used it, and why it was flawed

# Flaws
The biggest flaw was that the entire key was 56 bits, meaning it could be guessed eventually, while it was logistically impossible to do in the 80s, as computing power increased the time it would take to guess the key went down.

# Temporary Solution
![[Triple DES]]
