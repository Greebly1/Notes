Used to allow pedestrians, but not larger vehicles.

Can be implemented as bollards, concrete barriers, or even moats.

This prevents people from ramming a vehicle into the building to open it.
This is also a safety feature, in case someone loses control of a vehicle, a bollard can protect important gas lines and generators.
