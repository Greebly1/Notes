[[Ethernet]]

Haphazardly clobbering together a network, especially for commercial endeavors is too risky.
- Which cables go where?
- What computers are connected where?
- Loose cables are tripping hazards.
- Lack of physical security
- Cables exposed, prone to damage
- Hard to troubleshoot and diagnose
- Future upgrades and maintenance 
The competent IT admin has a a structure to their cabling.
# Office Space
This is where the non-IT personnel do work. Their workspace should be orderly, and always connected. Each workspace should have a number or ID associated with it for later troubleshooting in case of network issues.
Cables should not be strewn about on the ground, especially near chairs. If they must be then they should be taped down to prevent tripping.

Cables should then run to the nearest wall port, column, end row, etc, before making their way to the ceiling plenum space. If there are multiple workspaces it is ideal for several cables to be batched together. 
	Note: In some topologies it may be beneficial to connect a simple network switch here.

# Plenum Runs
From here the cables should transition to solid core plenum grade ethernet. Cable runs should travel parallel to the central communications hub. 

# Central Communications Hub
Successful commercial cabling often entails all cables to terminate at a single room. This allows the complexity to be centralized in one spot, and for physical security measures to be taken to protect access to critical components of the telecommunications systems. 

This room will house the necessary switches for each workspace room, the servers to provide data and authentication to work computers, as well as the routers and gateways.

To save space plenum cables that end up here can be slotted into a punchdown block (must be same category rating), a row of female ethernet connectors for ease of use. This way the delicate plenum cable does not need to be moved or bent. 
	The punchdown block should also be labelled per each workspace it corresponds to.

This room is the workspace for the IT personnel. Make sure to futureproof everything by keeping detailed documentation on the different cabling standards, categories, and connectors being used in your structured cabling installation.
