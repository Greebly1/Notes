Fused Deposition Modelling
	AKA, Filament Printing

The most common type of [[3D Printers]]

Melt a filament and print one layer, the print head moving across the 2D plane, then wait for it to dry and move up one layer and print the next layer.

**Pros**
- Larger print bed
- Easy to manage the filament
- Messes are small and easy to clean
