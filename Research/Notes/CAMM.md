# Pros
CAMM is intended to replace desktop tower [[DIMM]]s and SODIMMS in high end laptops.
- Improved airflow in case
- Dual channel by default
- Future plans for liquid cooling (the screws make that really easy to make mounting mechanisms)
- Improved signal clarity
- Can be placed anywhere on the MOBO by MOBO designers (since it doesn't stick out of the board, it doesn't conflict with expansion cards or heat sinks)
