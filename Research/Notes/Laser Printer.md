Combines paper, high voltage, charged ions, powdered ink, and paper.


# Printing Process
1. **Processing**
	The entire page to be printed is loaded into the memory of the printer.
2. **Charging**
	The imaging drum is loaded with a negative charge
3. **Exposing**
	Write the image onto the drum using a laser, an entire row at a time. Where the laser touches becomes positively charged.
4. **Developing**
	Add negatively charged toner to the imagine drum. It will only stick to where the laser exposed.
5. **Transferring**
	Transfer the toner to the paper
6. **Fusing**
	Apply heat and pressure to the paper to bond the toner
7. **Cleaning**
	Clean the tail end of the imaging drum in case it has extra toner left over.

# Maintenence
Careful when opening up the printer shortly after use, it may be very hot, especially at the fuser assembly
- Replace Toner Cartridge
	Messages tell you it is low (but not out)
	Sometimes includes an imaging drum
- Maintenance Kit
	Tons of specific parts that might wear due to heat
	Manufacturer tells when you should replace each part (after how many pages printed)
	Feed rollers, etc
- Calibration
	Colors might be off, most calibration is automatic though
- Cleaning (tons of toner and dust)
	Typically use cold water and isopropyl alcohol
	Special laser printer vacuum
	If toner goes on skin, use cold water to wash off
