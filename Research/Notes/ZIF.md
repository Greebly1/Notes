Zero Insertion Force

Either
1. A niche #legacy chip interface
2. A marketing buzzword that means a type of slot does not use hard force to insert

# Chip Interface

These were used back in the day to insert the old funny pinout chips into motherboards.

Today you will only see them on old ROM programmers.

# Zero Force
As the name suggests, ZIF slots do not use force. This is good since the insertion and removal of devices have historically been points of failure.

Common ZIF slots
- CPU sockets
- Some laptop ribbon ports
