A #Legacy controller chip on MOBOs for routing data between devices.

Slower than the [[North Bridge]], the data received by the southbridge originates from the CPU, and is forwarded by the North Bridge.

Essentially multiplexes several device ports and communications into one line.
	Also manages device prioritization, and sending of interrupts.
	Some also perform built in hardware security.
