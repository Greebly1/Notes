Laptops have batteries so that they can be disconnected from a wall outlet and turned truly portable.
	Laptop chargers should be AC-->DC converters rated for the correct wattage and/or frequency.

Depending on the manufacturer, this battery will either be removable or built-in to the board.

This battery is also essentially the PSU of a laptop, providing a DC current to the computer.
