High-Definition Multi-media Interface

HDMI is a #proprietary video interface that supports HD digital audio and video.
	Hit the market in 2003

HDMI uses [[LPCM]] for audio transfer.

HDMI is actually kind of slow, only really supporting up to 60hz [[Refresh Rate]]s
	This means it is kind of going out of date, being replaced by [[DisplayPort]] especially for high performance gaming

# Display Data
Computers use [[EDID]] to relay configuration data and supported features between the monitor through HDMI
