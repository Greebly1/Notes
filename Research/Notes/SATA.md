Serial ATA (Advanced Technology Attachment)

A replacement of [[PATA]], SATA provides a standard for connecting a host to a mass storage media.
	SSDs
	HDDs

# Connectors
SATA uses two different connectors, typically
	[[SATA Data]]
	[[SATA Power]]

For a SATA drive to work it must be powered, and connected to the data bus.

# [[AHCI]] vs [[IDE]]
SATA devices often support both AHCI and IDE
	AHCI though is the ideal control standard
	IDE is for legacy [[PATA]] compatibility

If a SATA slot supports AHCI it should always be set to use it, since it is faster.

# [[SATA Versions]]

# [[Hot Swap]] capable
Most SATA devices are capable of hot swapping, but first check the device specs before trying.
