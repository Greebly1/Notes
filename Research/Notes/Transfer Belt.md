For color laser printers, multiple colored toners must be used to develop color images.
	Magenta, Cyan, Yellow, Black
For this, 4 seperate imaging drums and 4 toner cartridges are required.

Instead of requiring 4 fusing steps per color, a transfer belt is used to collect all of the toner onto one single belt.
This belt then transfers all 4 toner colors to the paper.
The paper is fused once, and all the toner is bonded.
