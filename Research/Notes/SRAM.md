Static [[RAM]]

A  [[RAM]] technology that uses transistor flip flops and [[Latches]] to store binary data. Unlike its brother [[DRAM]], SRAM does not need to be refreshed.
So long as it is given constant power it doesn’t need to refresh itself

Pros
- Doesn’t need refresh cycles
- Faster than DRAM
Cons
- Takes up more space and uses more expensive materials
# Uses
Today we almost always only use SRAM for [[Cache]] memory.
This is also the type of memory that [[CMOS]] usually uses.
