	However ISO does not refer to that it almost always refers to a .iso file (sometimes a .img file), which is a single file that represents a virtual portable file system.

AKA
Disk image
# File System
ISO uses the [[UDF]] [[File System]]. 
When you save a directory into an ISO, it is converted into the disc file system

# Mounting
In most operating systems, ISOs can be mounted as a #virtual [[Hard Drive]]

# Deploying Software
ISOs are the industry standard way of deploying operating systems and hardware level software.
This is because, representing a file system, if it is extracted into the first partition of a hard drive, it can just contain a boot sector.
This is exactly the case with #Windows and even #linux
