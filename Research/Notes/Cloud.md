A *Cloud* or *The Cloud* is dominantly an #Enterprise marketing term that refers to systems that utilize computational hardware, data storage systems, and infrastructure to perform services for a local machine.

# Common Uses
Synchronization
	Sync files and changes between computers, so you can work on the same project on any work station
Big Data Storage
	The collection and processing of mass data cannot logistically be performed on a single workstation.
High-speed Infrastructure
	Internet software services can be localized to specific regions for speedy connectivity.

# [[Cloud Deployment Models]]
Whatever a cloud service may offer, it can be deployed to provide that service differently
	This entails allowing certain groups and organizations to use the cloud.

If you build your own cloud this may be called an 'internal cloud'
If you pay to use another cloud this may be called an 'external cloud'

# Cloud Characteristics
[[Rapid Elasticity]]
	The ability to scale up and down your service quickly and dynamically to meet requirements
	Seamless
	Instance resource allocation
High Availability
	Infrastructure is built to always be available
	Multiple network gateways
	High level RAID and data reliability

# Cloud Monetization
Two ways of monetizing clouds
- Metered Cloud Service
	Pay for what you use (computational power, memory)
- Flat Cloud Service
	Pay a flat monthly fee for access to service. Often combined with SAAS.
