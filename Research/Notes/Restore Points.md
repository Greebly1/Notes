A snapshot of the [[Windows Registry]], settings, and files

# Registry
A restore point saves an entire windows registry, IE all of the settings and program configuration data.

# System Files
Important files such as system DLLs, and drivers are backed up as well.

# Programs
Some programs that have been registered with the OS may be backed up as well.

# Not Covered
A restore point does not cover user files, such as photos or videos. And some programs not registered with the OS may not be backed up.
