[[EMF Bands]], [[WiFi]]

Channels are smaller blocks of frequencies within a band.

Not all channels are independent, just because two channels have different names does not mean they do not overlap. It is a good idea to use agreed-upon non-overlapping channels when possible.

# Channel Width
The wider a channel is, the more bandwidth it carries.

The width of a channel depends on which band it belongs to. 2.4Ghz channels are 2Mhz in width.

# Channel Bonding
Under special circumstances and configurations, wireless devices can combine two or more channels to form a wider channel, increasing bandwidth.

Example
	Two 20MHz wide channels in the 5 GHz band can be combined to form a 40 MHz channel.

Downside
	Increases congestion by taking up more valuable EMF spectrum space

# Regulations
The width and amount of channels in a band change from country to country due to their regulations.
