AKA
	Name Server
A name server stores actual [[DNS Record]]s for one or more domains (typically a lot of domains)

# Multiple [[TLD]]s
A single name server may (almost certainly) service domains from multiple [[TLD]]s
	This improves the versatility and reusability of the DNS infrastructure
	Multiple TLDs might be pointing to the same name server
