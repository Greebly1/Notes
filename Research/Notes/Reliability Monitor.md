A #Windows debugging tool used to see the history of a device's program failures in the past.

It will tell you the exact time a computer has shut off unexpectedly, when a program has failed, when updates have failed, when updates have succeeded, etc.

The monitor provides a reliability score, from 0-10 which rises steadily over time but drops each time a critical event occurs.
