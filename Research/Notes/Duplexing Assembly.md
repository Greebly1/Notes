Laser printing is a one sided mechanism. In order for a laser printer to print on two sides, the paper must be flipped manually and sent back through.
A duplexing assembly allows the printer to automatically do this. Its job is to flip the output and send it back to the intake.

These may be built into the printer, or offered as an extension/add-on.
