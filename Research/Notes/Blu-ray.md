An optical disc storage technology invented in 2006 to supersede [[DVD]]s for video storage.

Blu-ray's name comes from the use of a blue laser used to read the data, allowing for much greater data density.
	Blu-ray discs also have a bit of a blue hue to them.

# Transfer Rate
1x rpm produces 4.5 MB/s
	Blu-ray is read at 6x rpm
	27 MB/s

# File System
Blu-Ray utilizes [[UDF]], the universal disc format file system.

# HD Video
Blu-ray allows for storing several hours of HD video at higher framerates than DVDs.

# Video Games
Blu-ray has also been extensively used in video game storage and distribution, as the larger storage size accommodated the growing need of storage space for higher spec games.
	This was primarily leveraged with Playstation consoles, and was later used in Xbox.

Furthermore, game consoles that doubled as Blu-ray players allowed for much better marketing and rebranding of home entertainment devices.

# Ultra Blu-Ray
An even more ridiculous form of Blu-ray that supports ultra HD video.

These are not backwards compatible.
