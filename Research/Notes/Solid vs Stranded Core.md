# Solid vs Stranded
Stranded
	More flexible
	Worse conductivity
Solid
	Less flexible
	Superior conductivity
Better conductivity leads to better use of [[Power Over Ethernet]] with less heat dissipation meaning the POE injector can work more efficiently.
Improved conductivity also allows for longer cables, carrying the signal further before attenuation.
