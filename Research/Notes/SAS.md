Serial Attached [[SCSI]]

A hard drive interface derived from the #Legacy SCSI interface. 

The actual way the physical link works is completely different, using a serial data transport method.
It also has its own unique keyed ports and cables.
	However, we still call it SCSI because it conforms to the same software APIs. So tried and true SCSI control chips and software still work with SAS.
