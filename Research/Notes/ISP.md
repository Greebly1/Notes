Internet Service Provider

An ISP is a telecommunications company authorized by the [[IANA]] to provide IP addresses and routing to networks.

An ISP is given a block of IP addresses by a [[RIR]], the ISP simply assigns these addresses to networks they manage.

ex:
	A home network may be given IPv4 address 10.121.69.5 and a subnet mask 255:255:255:0
	This assigns a global IP to the network's modem of 10.121.69.5, and allows that network 256 devices.
