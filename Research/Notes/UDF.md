Universal Disc Format

Invented to go along with [[DVD]], the UDF removed a lot of the complexity involved with interpreting disc data.

UDF is actually a full [[File System]], designed specifically for optical media.

# Uses
Used primarily for
[[DVD]]
[[Blu-ray]]
It is even used in some modern [[Notes/CD]]s 

# Versioning
UDF uniquely, supports incremental writing and versioning of files. Kind of like how Git source control works.

Changing a file saves a new file that logs the changes made to the original file. This allows reads to put together any version of the file, since it saves the original and every change made.

# Mastering
Mastering refers to the process of finalizing a UDF file system to no longer accept changes.
It turns a UDF system into a sort of ROM.
