Simultaneous Authentication of Equals
a password-based #authentication and #key-exchange protocol used by [[WPA3]], it allows two parties to authenticate each other and set up a secure connection secretly.

# Password Based
In order to authenticate with the network you must possess the password that the network uses.

# Mesh Network
SAE is mostly used with wireless [[Mesh Networks]], where multiple devices may connect with one another, instead of using a star-bus topology that most wired networks use.

#TODO how does it actually work
