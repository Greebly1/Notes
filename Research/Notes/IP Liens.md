What happens to the IP of a mobile device that turns off, leaves range, or stops responding to the network permanently?
Before [[DHCP]], these dead IPs would still persist in the IP table, and never be usable again until an IT admin cleared them or reassigned them.

In a DHCP server, IPs are temporarily loaned. Depending on the DHCP settings the time may be anywhere from a few minutes, to a few weeks. If the device is still connected the loan is either extended, or a new IP is given.
	Internet cafes may loan out IPs for shorter periods of time
	Private residential networks may loan IPs for much longer
