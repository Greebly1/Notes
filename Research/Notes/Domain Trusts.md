A feature in [[Active Directory]] that allows multiple domains to 'trust' each other. This means they can share certain resources between each other.

For example, a small community college domain may be trusted to access the digital library of a state college.

May be used on a smaller scale, for instance a giant company might segment itself into multiple domains
- company.sales
- company.production
- company.us
- company.fr
- etc
