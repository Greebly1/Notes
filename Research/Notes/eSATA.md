The eSATA briefly provided some quality of like features to hard drive power users by allowing external hot swapping of SATA drives.

# Powered Version
A powered form of eSATA named eSATAp exists. The need arose since just since a eSATA cable was connected to a peripheral drive, didn't mean it was powered.

# Hellish [[USB]] compliant adapters
Very rarely an eSATAp port also supported the USB keying.
This allowed for either an eSATAp cable or a USB cable.

# USB Adapters
Adapters exist between eSATAp and USB, allowing eSATA drives to be connected via USB. It is quite slow though.
