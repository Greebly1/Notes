One or more connected computers whose messages can collide with each other.
This happens in [[Half-Duplex]] networks mostly since they cannot send and receive at the same time
Mediums such as
- [[Coaxial Cable]]
- [[WiFi]]
- [[Cellular]]

Collisions do not happen in full duplex networks
# Collision Handling
A number of (mostly hardware level) protocols have been developed to solve this issue
[[CSMA/CD]]
[[CSMA/CA]]
