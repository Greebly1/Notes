A windows account or windows user is a set of settings, privileges that represent a virtual desktop workstation for that user.

Each user has
- Their own home directory
- Their own [[HKU]] hive
- Their own desktop
- Their own username and password
- [[NTFS Permissions]]
Combined all of these differences allows them to personalize their workstation, when they log in the windows machine will load all of their data and it will be just like they configured it for themself.

Among this data can be set some personal info such as
- name
- email
- title
- etc...

	Groups are a way to manage users.
